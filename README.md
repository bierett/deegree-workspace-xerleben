## XErleben Schema

The XErleben schema (abbr. XE) is a GML application schema. The schema is divided into 8 sub-schemes and can be download as a zip archive from [XErleben] [1].
Have a look at [XErleben Complex Workspace](#deegree-workspace-xerleben-complex) to use the full GML application schema with complex FeatureTypes . If you want to use non-complex FeatureTypes have a look at [XErleben Syn Workspace](#deegree-workspace-xerleben-syn).

## XErleben Complex Workspace

The XErleben Complex Workspace is based on the complex XErleben GML application schema (using complex FeatureTypes).

## XErleben Syn Workspace

The XErleben Syn Workspace is based on an ESRI ShapeFile (using non-complex FeatureTypes).
